Installing Encode Arabic
========================

This package is prepared with [Cabal](https://github.com/haskell/cabal). You need to install [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform) to get it along with the [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) compiler.

When done with the above, open the command line, navigate to this directory of the repository, and run the following:

    cabal update
    cabal install

You should then have this package installed, including the library and the binaries:

    encode --help
    decode --help

Enjoy! ^^
